       "\"The latest version of OpenAI's Generative Pre-trained Transformer model is GPT-5, which was launched on August 7, 2025. It is described as OpenAI’s “smartest, fastest, most useful model yet” and comes with enhanced features and capabilities compared to earlier versions. The release includes new variants such as GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano, GPT-5-pro, and GPT-5-thinking, offering different levels of power and processing capabilities tailored to specific needs. The Pro tier subscription provides users with unlimited access to GPT-5 and its more advanced versions like GPT-5-pro and GPT-5-thinking, which allows for extended query processing. The model also includes enhanced multimodal capabilities and can handle voice, canvas, search, and potentially video processing, making it a significant leap from previous models ([wired.com](https://www.wired.com/story/openais-gpt-5-is-here/), [fortune.com](https://fortune.com/2025/08/07/gpt-5-everything-new-different-hallucinations-personalities-vibecoding-agents-openai/), [linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/gpt-5-ai-revolution-thats-change-everything-again-gabriel-varaljay-nqdre)).\""

According to OpenAI, free users will get access to GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini, while the Plus subscription includes the same models with “significantly higher” usage limits. OpenAI says that the $200 a month Pro tier offers unlimited GPT-5 access, along with GPT-5-pro, a more powerful version of the model, and GPT-5-thinking, which allows the model to process a query for longer than usual. Pro users will still have access to pick through legacy models. Most users will no longer need to choose between models, as the chat interface now automatically routes to the right version depending on the complexity of the query and the user’s subscription tier.'},\n",
