# irouter

> irouter is a Python (3.10+) library that provides easy access to 100+ LLMs through OpenRouter's API. It simplifies LLM interactions to just 2 lines of code while supporting both single and multiple model calls.

Things to remember when using irouter:
- You must set the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` environment variable or pass `api_key` directly to objects such as `Call` and `Chat`.
- irouter supports 300+ models via OpenRouter including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more.
- You can pass custom OpenAI client configurations for advanced usage.
- Use `Call()` for simple one-off LLM interactions.
- Use `Chat()` for conversational interfaces with message history and token tracking.
- Supports both single model calls and multi-model parallel calls.
- Built on top of the `openai.OpenAI` Python client.

## Setup
```bash
pip install irouter
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

## Core Components
- `get_all_models()`: View all 300+ available models.
- `Call`: Simple interface for one-off LLM calls (single or multiple models)
- `Chat`: Conversational interface with message history and usage tracking

## Basic Usage
```python
from irouter import Call, Chat

# Single model call
c = Call(model="moonshotai/kimi-k2:free")
c("Who are you?")

# Multiple models
c = Call(model=["moonshotai/kimi-k2:free", "google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free"])
c("Who are you?")

# Chat with history
chat = Chat(model="moonshotai/kimi-k2:free")
chat("Hello!")
print(chat.history, chat.usage)
```
